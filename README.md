# LIRI

## Overview
 **LIRI** is a node App designed to function similar to SIRI on the iPhone.  Instead of utilizing speech recognition, LIRI takes in commands through terminal to provide specific data.

## Commands
 To operate, LIRI will need you to type `node liri.js` and one of the following commands along with an additional piece of information:
  1. `concert-this`: Type in the name of any band at the end of your command line to return any upcoming events where your band will be showcased.  Returned information will include the name and location of the venue, as well as the date of the event.

  2. `spotify-this-song`: Add the name of any song to the end of your cammand line to return the artist, song name, a Spotify preview link, and the name of the album where the song was featured.

  3. `movie-this`: Want to know more information about your favorite movie? Type the name of the movie at the end of the command line to return the movie title, release year, IMB and Rotten Tomatoes ratings, native language, plot, and movie actors/actresses.

  4. `do-what-it-says`: Up for a little intrigue?  Type do-what-it-says at the end of your command line to return something interesting.
